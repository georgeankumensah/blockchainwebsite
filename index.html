        Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on
        the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Bitcoin transactions are verified by
        network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed
        ledger called a blockchain.

            Bitcoin (â‚¿) is a decentralized digital currency that can be
            transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. Bitcoin
            transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and
            recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. The
            cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of
            people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in
            2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.
            Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They
            can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Bitcoin has been described as an economic bubble by at least eight
            Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. Journalists, economists,
            investors, and the central bank of Estonia have voiced concerns that
            bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme. The word bitcoin was defined in a white
            paper published on 31 October 2008. It is a compound of the words
            bit and coin. No uniform convention for bitcoin capitalization
            exists; some sources use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the
            technology and network and bitcoin, lowercase, for the unit of
            account. The Wall Street Journal, The Chronicle of Higher Education,
            and the Oxford English Dictionary advocate the use of lowercase
            bitcoin in all cases.
